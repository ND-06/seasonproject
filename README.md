# Season Project Assignement


##This little assignement is build under react and semantic-ui.

It was made in order to train myself about basics of react. 
This app detects automatically by geolocation the season of the User. 

For example, if the user is located at Sao Paulo, Brazil in July 2019, that's means the current season is Winter ! 
If the user is located at San Francisco in July 2019, that's means the current season is Summer !

For each season, a custom display is rendered.
I've used navigator geolocation function to detect the latitude of the user , and then to display the right current season.

Use sensor in your browser console to test the result with another location !

Simple assignement but very instructive !
